implement of some common graph algorithms

### Dijkstra's Algorithm:

Dijkstra's algorithm is arguably one of the most common algorithm used to find
the shortest path between the source vertex to every other vertex in the graph.
The most common data structure used to implement this algorithm is a
min-priority queue. As we enqueue each unvisited vertex, we pop from the
priority queue according to the minimum weight (This technique is also known as
a greedy algorithm). We push onto the priority queue if we can find a better
path (smaller edge weight). The overall time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm
is *O(V<sup>2</sup>)* but is reduced to
*O(|V| + |E|log|V|)* when implemented using a min-priority queue.
